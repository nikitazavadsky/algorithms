# DESCRIPTION
This repository was created to fill it with some algorithm realizations on python.
I am currently working on 'Algorithms Illuminated' by Tim Roughgarden.

## List of currently implemented algorithms (see notes first):
  * ### [Merge sort](https://github.com/nikitazavadsky/algorithms/blob/master/merge_sort/merge_sort.py)
  * ### [Karatsuba multiplication](https://github.com/nikitazavadsky/algorithms/blob/master/karatsuba_multiplication/karatsuba.py)

## Notes
  * Karatsuba multiplication doesn't work correctly for large numbers (*IN PROGRESS*)
